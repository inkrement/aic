% whats sentiment analysiss
The aim of sentiment analysis is to determine and try to measure positive and negative feelings, emotions and opinions written in a text. English as language allows to express the same intent in different ways. The main challenge therefore consists in abstracting the intention of the writer from the grammatic and language specific rules. 

% steps
In general sentiment analysis can be splitted into 2 steps: a preprocessing and a constitutive sentiment analysis phase. In Twitter sentiment analysis there is another step right bevor preprocessing: fetching the data from the application programming interface (API). This task is not trivial, because the official API is limited regarding the datasets fetched within certain intervals. This leads to the requirement of a caching mechanism to avoid fetching the same tweets multiple times and allow the usage of more datasets.

\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, node distance=3.3cm,>=latex']
    \node [block] (input) {Twitter};
    \node [block, right of=input, pin={[pinstyle]above:Cache}] (proprocess) {Preprocessing};
    \node [block, right of=proprocess] (analyse) {Analysis};

    \draw [->] (proprocess) -- node[name=u] {$u$} (analyse);
    \draw [->] (input) -- node {$fetch$} (proprocess);
\end{tikzpicture}
