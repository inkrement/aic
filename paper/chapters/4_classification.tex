\subsection{Machine Learning Algorithms}
According to the paper by Qiang et al.\autocite{Ye20096527} the most important approaches in 
text mining and sentiment classification are Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and 
N-gram. Maximum Entropy Classification is also often mentioned by various papers regarding 
classification in sentiment analysis.
