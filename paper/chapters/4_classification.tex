\section{Classification}
Insert general classification information here.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Supervised vs. unsupervised
\item Training Set
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Machine Learning Algorithms}
According to the paper by Qiang et al.\autocite{Ye20096527} the most important approaches in 
text mining and sentiment classification are Naive Bayes, SVM and 
N-gram.
