abstract = {Sentiment analysis over Twitter offer organisations a fast and effective way to monitor the publics’ feelings towards their brand, business, directors, etc. A wide range of features and methods for training sentiment classiﬁers for Twitter datasets have been researched in recent years with varying results. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of adding semantics as additional features into the training set for sentiment analysis. For each extracted entity (e.g. iPhone) from tweets, we add its semantic concept (e.g. “Apple product”) as an additional feature, and measure the correlation of the representative concept with negative/positive sentiment. We apply this approach to predict sentiment for three different Twitter datasets. Our results show an average increase of F harmonic accuracy score for identifying both negative and positive sentiment of around 6.5\% and 4.8\% over the baselines of unigrams and part-of-speech features respectively. We also compare against an approach based on sentiment-bearing topic analysis, and ﬁnd that semantic features produce better Recall and F score when classifying negative sentiment, and better Precision with lower Recall and F score in positive sentiment classiﬁcation.},

abstract = {Twitter is a popular microblogging service where users create status messages (called "tweets"). These tweets sometimes express opinions about different topics. The purpose of this project is to build an algorithm that can accurately classify Twitter messages as positive or negative, with respect to a query term. Our hypothesis is that we can obtain high accuracy on classifying sentiment in Twitter messages using machine learning techniques. Generally, this type of sentiment analysis is useful for consumers who are trying to research a product or service, or marketers researching public opinion of their company.},

abstract = {An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think.With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented informationseeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentimentaware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis.We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.},

@article{Liu2010,
abstract = {Textual information in the world can be broadly categorized into two main types: facts and opinions. Facts are objective expressions about entities, events and their properties. Opinions are usually subjective expressions that describe peoples sentiments, appraisals or feelings toward entities, events and their properties. The concept of opinion is very broad. In this chapter, we only focus on opinion expressions that convey peoples positive or negative sentiments. Much of the existing research on textual information processing has been focused on mining and retrieval of factual information, e.g., information retrieval, Web search, text classification, text clustering and many other text mining and natural language processing tasks. Little work had been done on the processing of opinions until only recently. Yet, opinions are so important that whenever we need to make a decision we want to hear others opinions. This is not only true for individuals but also true for organizations.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative. Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.},
